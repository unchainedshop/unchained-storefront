            personal information, assuming we figure out how to do any of those

            Information We Collect (Accidentally)
          </h2>

            We collect various types of information about you, including but not
            limited to: your name, email address, shopping preferences, browsing
            habits, favorite color, childhood fears, and the name of your first
            pet. We also accidentally collect information about what you had for
            breakfast, though we&apos;re not sure why our system does that or
            how to make it stop. Sometimes we collect information we didn&apos;t
            even know we were collecting, which surprises us as much as it
            probably surprises you.

            We promise not to sell your data to anyone unless they offer us a

            including our payment processors, shipping partners, the government
            (if they ask nicely), and occasionally with our competitors by
            accident when we send emails to the wrong mailing list. We also
            share aggregated, anonymized data with researchers studying the
            declining attention spans of internet users.

            Our website uses cookies, not the delicious kind but the digital

            remember who you are, what you like, and where you&apos;ve been on
            our site. We also use tracking pixels, which are like digital
            Post-it notes that stick to your browser. Some of these cookies are
            essential, others are just nosy. You can disable cookies in your
            browser, but then our website might forget who you are and treat you
            like a stranger at a party.

            We protect your data using industry-standard security measures,
            which is business speak for &quot;we installed some software and
            hope it works.&quot; Our security measures include encryption,
            firewalls, secure servers, and a very aggressive security guard
            (actually just the office cat, but it&apos;s surprisingly
            effective). While we cannot guarantee absolute security, we can
            guarantee that we&apos;ll be just as surprised as you if something
            goes wrong.
