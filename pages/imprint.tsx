            This company is managed by a board of directors consisting entirely
            of people who are excellent at making decisions they don't
            understand about things they've never seen. Our CEO is rumored to be
            either a very sophisticated chatbot or three cats in a business
            suit. The CFO is definitely a golden retriever with an MBA from an
            unaccredited online university.

            we reserve the right to be confused by them.
